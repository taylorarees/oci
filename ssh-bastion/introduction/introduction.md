# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Bastion hosts are important when it comes to security, access control, and efficiency. A bastion host acts as a single point of controlled access for authorized users. The Bastion host becomes the only ingress path to internal sources to simplify security administration. 
Bastion sessions let authorized users in possession of the private key in an SSH key pair connect to a target resource for a predetermined amount of time. You provide the public key in the SSH key pair at the time you create the session, and then supply the private key when you connect.
This lab walks you through how to securely access your bastion host through SSH.
